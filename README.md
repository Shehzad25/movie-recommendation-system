# movie-recommendation-system
This Movie Recommendation System suggests similar movies using NLP and cosine similarity. It processes movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview), applies stemming, and converts text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer. The system calculates similarity scores with cosine similarity and retrieves the top 5 most similar movies.
